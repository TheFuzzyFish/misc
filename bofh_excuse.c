/*
 * This is an excuse generator based off the excuses
 * featured in the comic Bastard Operator from Hell.
 * Compile with `gcc -o bofh_excuse bofh_excuse.c`
 * Feel free to attach this executable to a network
 * socket, which is easy with Netcat on supported versions:
 * `while true; do nc -lvp 666 -e ./bofh_excuse; done`
 * This program is entirely self-contained, and if you
 * want to add excuses of your own, you'll need to manually
 * append them to the excuses[] array in main().
